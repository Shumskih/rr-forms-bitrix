                            <p>Yeah well, you shouldn\'t drink. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? What do you mean you\'ve seen this, it\'s brand new. You\'re gonna be in the car with her.</p>
                        <p>Shit. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I\'ll get fired. You wouldn\'t want that to happen would you? Would you? Doc, you gotta help- Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don\'t want her to worry about you. I don\'t know, I can\'t keep up with all of your boyfriends.</p>
                        <p>Excuse me. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. But I can\'t go to the dance, I\'ll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Will you take care of that? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.</p>
                        <p>Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn\'t due till Monday- I think it\'s terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Look, I\'m just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it\'s 8:25? Good evening, I\'m Doctor Emmett Brown. I\'m standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It\'s Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C\'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that\'s it.</p>
                        <p>That\'s a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. No. Aw yeah, everything is great. Don\'t pay any attention to him, he\'s in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let\'s see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that\'s Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.</p>                    </p>
